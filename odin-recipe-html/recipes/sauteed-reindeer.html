          Cooked for several hours on low heat, in butter and/or beer if
          available. It is most often made with reindeer meat but other meats
          like beef or elk can be used as an alternative.

              Freeze the meat for 20 minutes then slice as thin as possible
            </li>
            <li>
              Warm the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion
              and saute until softened. Stir in the garlic and saute until
              aromatic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the meat, salt, pepper, allspice, and water, stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bring to a simmer, then cover, reduce heat to low and gently
              simmer until the meat is tender.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove the lid and increase heat to medium-high. Saute, stirring
