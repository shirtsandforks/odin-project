## The Odin Project

The Odin Project is a free course/curriculum for those that want to learn web development by them self and it's great.

I originally started this in 2021 and finished most of it. I didn't have enough time for it back then because of the job that i had. It could take few weeks to get back on the project and it was really bothering my learning. I was rushing on things because time was limited. It was mostly weekends that i had the time but i was really tired of the actual job + i wanted to give my spare time to my dogs.

Now that I quit my job i wanted to start over and this time make a github repo ðŸ˜Š. Along the way I might use frameworks like react and/or svelte on some projects also.
