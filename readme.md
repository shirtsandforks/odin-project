# The Odin Project

I originally started this in 2021 and left unfinished because I didn't have enough time for it back then, mainly because of job that i had.

I thought i'd give it another go now that i have actually have time for it.

_The Odin Project is a free course/curriculum for those that want to learn web development by them self and it's great._

## Odin recipes

The task at hand here is just the layout of the page. No styles, no scripts just the html.
CSS ja JS part is added later.
